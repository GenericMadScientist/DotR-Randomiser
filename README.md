DotR Randomiser
===============

This is the Duelists of the Roses Randomiser, currently Version Alpha 0.2.

This repository has now been archived and I am not interested in receiving any contributions. If you wish to make your own randomiser I would suggest starting from scratch, but feel free to fork and maintain this yourself if you wish.

Usage
-----

Windows only for the time being, although if anyone wants to run this on a different OS then let me know.

For now, this randomiser can randomise starter decks, disable the Deck Cost check before duels, and give everyone Deck Master K's AI. If you leave the last two unticked then it will restore the DC check and the normal AIs respectively, but right now there's no way to restore the original starter decks.

Be warned that currently this randomiser will overwrite the iso you give it, so make a copy beforehand.
